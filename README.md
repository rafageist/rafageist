# Hello, I'm @rafageist 👋

Welcome to my digital realm! I'm a passionate software developer with a journey that spans from the early days of programming to specializing in web technologies, large-scale systems, and automation.

## 🚀 About Me

From my first forays into programming at the age of 11 to my formal education as a computer engineer, I've experienced and learned from every phase of my journey. With more than two decades of professional experience, I specialize in web development, database systems, Linux, and more recently, mobile app development, large-scale systems, and DevOps practices.
