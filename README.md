# Hi

I entered the world of computing in **1997**, writing small programs as a kid in Cuba.  Since then, I’ve turned that passion into a career spanning **software engineering, entrepreneurship, and research**. 

> [!NOTE]
> ⚡ *Three decades in tech and still learning, still building, still sharing.*
